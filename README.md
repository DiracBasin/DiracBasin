<p align='center'>Heillo gays I'm a high school student (CN) who learns html/css/js out of personal interest (I don't seem to have an adequate level of logical intelligence for this though..)
I still wanna stick to this, despite the fact that any form of coding wouldn't be a hobby relaxing enough for some1 who's already under great pressure of study..
(of course I don't really have time to dig deeper in this.)
By the way the reason why I signed up for Github still remains a mystery (for myself!😂) to solve</p>
