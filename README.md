Heillo gays I'm a high school student (CN) who learns html/css/js out of personal interest (I don't seem to have an adequate level of logical intelligence though..)
I still wanna stick to this, despite the fact that any form of coding wouldn't be a hobby relaxing enough for some1 who's already under great pressure of study..
